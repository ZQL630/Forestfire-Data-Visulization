# We decided to use tree map for the data visualization. We first is simply compute monthly average temperature as X axis, and set the sum of burned area each month as Y axis and then make the filter as the average temperature every month. The area of each element shows the size of burned area each month, which can be easily distinguished. From the graph, it is easily to find that the months with higher temperature tend to have larger burned area than others, especially August and September.
